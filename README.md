# WiFoo

A super-lightweight UI front-end for [aireplay-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=aireplay-ng). Disconnects devices from any wifi, even if you are not connected to it.

All modules used in this script are from the python standard library. No need to download additional libraries :)

Tested with [aircrack-ng-1.2](http://download.aircrack-ng.org/aircrack-ng-1.2.tar.gz). I suggest you use this version.
