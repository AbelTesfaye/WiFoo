Disconnects devices from any wifi, even if you are not connected to it. 

A super-lightweight UI front-end for [aireplay-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=aireplay-ng). 





All modules used in this script are from the python standard library. No need to download additional libraries :)

Tested with [aircrack-ng-1.2](http://download.aircrack-ng.org/aircrack-ng-1.2.tar.gz). I suggest you use this version.
